What is Transifex?
------------------

Transifex is a modern localization platform.

It's an online, cloud-based, highly scalable translation management and
workflow tool, with a focus to integrate well with the existing workflow of
agile development teams and translators.

The name comes from latin and means 'Translation artisan'.

Key features:

- Workflow Management: Full control over your localization process. Great
  integrations with your own systems and workflow using our client app,
  libraries and a rich API.

- Continuous Localization: An online internationalization tool which adapts
  to the production cycle of fast-paced teams with dynamic content and agile
  releases.

- Coordinated Collaboration: Create self-managed language teams under your
  project. Invite 10 professional or 10.000 volunteer translators. Or both.

- Quality Control: Translation Memory, glossary, proofreading, translation
  suggestions with voting. All the tools you'll ever need to ensure high quality.


More than 25 localization formats are supported including Gettext, Java, HTML,
XML, iOS, Ruby, RESX, PHP and XLIFF.
